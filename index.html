					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>The content on this website covers the chord progressions
						and other general patterns of my favorite songs, because I wanted a medium to convey the wonderful 
						qualities of these sounds. I hope that this content will find you well, and that maybe you will be 
						inspired to think about the design of the songs that you enjoy. </p>

							<h4>Drain You - Nirvana</h4>
							<p>The main chord progression of <i>Drain You</i> is the following four chords:</p>

							<p>One thing you might have noticed about these chords is that they sound entirely different from the 
								typical chord progression. The first interesting note about them is that they are all "power chords",
								aka they all only utilize the first and fifth of the chord. These chords are A5, C#5, F#5,
								and B5. The lack of a major or minor third would normally create a sense of neutrality in tone, but the 
								remarkable aspect of these power chords is that the root of each of them (the first) is either the major third,
								the fourth, or the minor seventh of the next chord. In essence, we get our own melodic line by listening carefully
								to the moving first of the chord.

							<p>Even though this song only contains two main chords, these chords create significant 
								tension between one another--enough to hold the entire tone of the song. These two chords are 
								E major and C major, and even though they are entirely different in key, they share some common ground. 
								The major third of C major is E, and E is the root (first) of the E major chord. We are already drawn
								into a brighter, more fuller theme with these two notes. The kicker of this chord progression is the draw back from 
								G# into G (and B to C). These two pairs of notes are both half-steps apart, giving us a significant amount of tension 
								between them. Furthermore, the tension is resolved in two different ways! (moving up and moving down!) We can really 
								feel the pull from these chords and the uneasiness as we are rocked in two different directions.

							<p>This song has a stable chord progression, going between E major and its relative minor, 
								 C# minor. The stability in the shared notes, E and G#, allow the C# to shine when it 
								 comes out and heighten the interval of the minor third. On a more personal note, I've listened to this song on repeat for multiple 
								 years, and it's become one of my favorites because of the way my brain overlaps sensory input 
								 with music, particularly with the keys of E/A major (and their relative minor keys). For more information on 
								 this topic, stay tuned!
